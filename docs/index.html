        <h2 is-upgraded>Welcome, student!</h2>
<p>This codelab is intended to teach you about the <a href="http://2020.argo.run" target="_blank">2020 Argonaut</a> initiative for <a href="https://github.com/argonautproject/patient-lists" target="_blank">Patient Lists</a> by walking you through a coding exercise that uses the new API.</p>
<aside class="special"><h3 is-upgraded>Profile Audience</h3>
<p>This guide is intended for programmers who wish to <em>learn by doing</em>.  You should already have a working knowledge of web programing, access to a development machine, and about <strong>1 to 2 total hours</strong> to dedicate to completing the whole codelab.<br><br>Your completion time will vary based on your familiarity with Javascript, web programming concepts, and the APIs in general.<br></p>
</aside>
<h3 is-upgraded>Prerequisites</h3>
<p>This guide assumes you are already familiar with javascript and are comfortable with web programming concepts.  It also helps to know the basics of <code>git</code>, but there will be example commands throughout for convenience.  The provided initial codebase uses <code>javascript</code>, <code>node</code>, <code>nvm</code>, <code>npm</code>, and <code>express</code> - so some prior experience with those tools will be helpful, but not required.  JavaScript in the browser and in Node.js, and the express Web framework for Node.js</p>
<h3 is-upgraded>Contributing</h3>
<p>As always, you are free to re-write entire portions of the code in whatever framework you like (and please feel free to share your work with us)!</p>
<p>The codelab has a wiki which should help you decide how to best contribute:<br><a href="https://github.com/microsoft-healthcare-madison/demo-patient-lists/wiki" target="_blank">https://github.com/microsoft-healthcare-madison/demo-patient-lists/wiki</a></p>
<p>Also, take notice of the <a href="https://github.com/microsoft-healthcare-madison/demo-patient-lists/issues" target="_blank">Report a mistake</a> link that appears in the lower left corner of each page!</p>
<h3 is-upgraded>Major Milestones</h3>
<p>You will start with an already-implemented app that displays an empty table of patients that will be visited by a doctor who is walking rounds in a hospital.</p>
<ul>
<li>v1: Provide a remote FHIR server to pull patients from, displaying the default list of patients.</li>
<li>v2: Implement filters, restricting the patient list to meet specified criteria.</li>
<li>v3: Include other patient details in the displayed table, fetching it from related resources using a <a href="https://www.hl7.org/fhir/questionnaire.html" target="_blank"><br>Questionnaire</a>.</li>
</ul>

        <h2 is-upgraded>Patient Lists API</h2>
<p>Provider-facing apps often need to know things like:</p>
<ul>
<li>Who are the patients I&#39;m seeing today?</li>
<li>Who are the patients I&#39;m responsible for in the hospital right now?</li>
<li>Who are the patients in this ward?</li>
</ul>
<aside class="warning"><h3 is-upgraded>Vendor-specific APIs</h3>
<p>Non-FHIR APIs provide access to this kind of information, but it&#39;s hard to write a cross-platform app for patient management without a standard approach.<br></p>
</aside>
<p>The FHIR Patient Lists will define a few key &#34;list types&#34; and ensure that FHIR-based apps can interact with lists as needed.  The initial focus is read-only access to lists.</p>

        <h2 is-upgraded>Instructions</h2>
<p>Begin by cloning the repository that contains the skeletal app and installing it locally on your machine.</p>
<pre><code>cd ~
mkdir -p code/msft-madison
cd $_
git clone git@github.com:barabo/demo-patient-lists.git
cd demo-patient-lists
</code></pre>
