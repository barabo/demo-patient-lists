# demo-patient-lists
A demonstration app and codelab companion to interactively teach developers how to use the FHIR Patient Lists API.

# Codelab
The codelab is hosted on GitHub pages at: <https://microsoft-healthcare-madison.github.io/demo-patient-lists>

## Running Locally
The codelab is built and tested locally in OSX (although it should work in windows, too) by running:
```bash
npm run codelab
```

This requires that you already have the [claat](https://github.com/googlecodelabs/tools/tree/master/claat) and [kqwait](https://github.com/sschober/kqwait) tools installed.
